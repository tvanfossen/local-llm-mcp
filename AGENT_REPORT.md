# Agent Operations Analysis Report

## Current State Analysis (2025-09-14)

### Available Agents
Three agents are currently registered in the system:
1. **GameController** (ID: 84fe2f63...) - Main game controller and entry point
2. **ChessRulesExpert** (ID: 85cda24f...) - Chess rules and game logic expert
3. **BoardArchitect** (ID: 0b570b4a...) - Board data structures expert

### Issue Discovered with Agent Chat Implementation

**Problem**: When using `mcp__local-llm-agents__agent_operations` with operation "chat", the response returned is not the expected agent-generated code but rather a conversational explanation.

**Expected Behavior**:
- Agent should generate actual Python code files (e.g., src/game/engine.py)
- Agent should perform file operations to create the requested components
- Response should indicate files created/modified

**Actual Behavior**:
- Agent returned conversational text explaining what it would do
- No actual code generation occurred
- No files were created or modified
- Response format was more like a planning discussion rather than code execution

**Technical Analysis**:
1. The chat handler in `src/mcp/tools/agent_operations/agent_operations.py:307` correctly calls `chat_with_agent()`
2. The response formatting at line 310-315 shows proper structure for file modifications
3. The `task_type` parameter was set to "conversation" by default, which may be causing the issue

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
The agents may need `task_type: "code_generation"` or `task_type: "file_edit"` instead of the default "conversation" type to actually generate and write code files.

### Recommendations for PyChess Orchestration

1. **Use Correct Task Types**: When requesting code generation, explicitly set `task_type: "code_generation"` or `task_type: "file_edit"`

2. **Verify Agent Capabilities**: Test each agent individually with appropriate task types before full orchestration

3. **Monitor File Creation**: Check if agents actually create files in the PyChess directory structure

4. **Registry Integrity Issues**: The stats showed "L Issues" for registry integrity - this should be investigated

### Next Steps for Testing

1. Try chat operations with `task_type: "code_generation"`
2. Check if agents have proper file system access to `/home/tvanfossen/Projects/PyChess`
3. Verify agent specialization files are correctly configured
4. Test file creation capabilities before proceeding with full orchestration

## Critical Discovery: Code Generation Not Implemented

**MAJOR ISSUE FOUND**: The `_handle_code_generation()` method in `src/core/agents/agent/agent.py:259` returns a hardcoded message:

```python
content="Code generation with tool integration not yet fully implemented"
```

This explains why agents return conversational responses instead of generating actual code.

## Llama Instance and MCP Tool Setup Analysis

### Llama Configuration
- **LLM Manager**: Located in `src/core/llm/manager/manager.py`
- **Model**: Uses `llama-cpp-python` with configurable parameters
- **Context Size**: Default 8192 tokens (configurable via `n_ctx`)
- **Status**: Agents are properly initialized with LLM manager

### MCP Tool Exposure to Agents

**Tool Executor Access**: ✅ **CONFIRMED**
- Agents have access to `tool_executor` via constructor parameter
- Tool executor includes all 5 MCP tools: workspace, git_operations, local_model, validation, agent_operations
- Registry properly updates agents with `update_toolchain()` method

**Tool Availability**: ✅ **AVAILABLE**
- Agents can execute workspace operations (file read/write/list)
- Tools are accessible via `await self.tool_executor.execute_tool("workspace", args)`
- Evidence found in `_create_file_from_request()` and `_handle_directory_list()`

**Critical Gap**: ❌ **NOT DIRECTED TO USE TOOLS**
- Agent prompts in `get_context_for_llm()` do NOT mention available tools
- Llama model receives basic context but no tool instruction
- No system prompt tells the model it can create files via tool calls

### Current Conversation Flow
1. User sends chat request with task_type="conversation" (default)
2. Agent uses `_handle_conversation()` which sends basic prompt to Llama
3. Llama responds with conversational text (no tool usage)
4. No file creation or code generation occurs

### Code Generation Flow (BROKEN)
1. User sends chat request with task_type="code_generation"
2. Agent calls `_handle_code_generation()`
3. Method returns hardcoded "not implemented" message
4. No actual code generation or file creation occurs

### Alternative Approach
1. Code generation functionality not implemented (`agent.py:259`)
2. Agents not instructed to use available MCP tools in their prompts
3. Would require significant development to make agents functional for code generation

**Immediate Options**:
1. Direct file creation using Write/Edit tools based on sample_prompt.json specifications
2. Manual implementation of the PyChess architecture components
3. Fix agent code generation (development task outside current scope)

## Latest Test Results (2025-09-14 12:20)

### Code Generation Test - PARTIALLY WORKING ✅❌
**Good News**: Code generation is actually implemented and working:
- Qwen2.5-7B model loads successfully (8192 context, -1 GPU layers)
- Agent receives code_generation request properly
- LLM generates code response
- Agent processes the request through _handle_code_generation()

**Critical Issues Identified**:

1. **Workspace Write Failure** ❌
   - Log: "Failed to write generated code to main.py: Unknown error during file write"
   - Agent generates code but workspace tool fails to write file
   - Root cause: Workspace path or permission issues

2. **MCP Tool Error Handling Bugs** ❌
   - `KeyError: 'error'` in agent_operations.py:317
   - `KeyError: 'status'` in agent_operations.py:236
   - Error handling assumes response structure that doesn't exist

3. **Agent Registry Data Issues** ❌
   - Agent info missing 'status' field
   - Error responses missing 'error' field
   - Data structure mismatch between registry and MCP tool

### Specific Technical Problems Found:

1. **Line 317** in `src/mcp/tools/agent_operations/agent_operations.py`:
   ```python
   return create_mcp_response(False, result["error"])  # KeyError: result has no 'error' key
   ```

2. **Line 236** in same file:
   ```python
   info_text += f"Status: {agent['status']}\n"  # KeyError: agent has no 'status' key
   ```

3. **Workspace Tool Integration**:
   - Workspace path: `/workspace` (from environment)
   - Write operation fails with "Unknown error during file write"
   - Possible permission/path issues in Docker container

### Agent System Status - PARTIALLY FUNCTIONAL

**✅ Working Components**:
- LLM model loading and inference (Qwen2.5-7B)
- Agent initialization and registry
- Code generation request processing
- MCP protocol communication

**❌ Broken Components**:
- File writing via workspace tool
- Error handling in MCP layer
- Agent info/status retrieval
- Complete code generation workflow

**PyChess Orchestration Status**: **IN PROGRESS** - Fixes applied and working

## PyChess Implementation Progress (2025-09-14 17:30)

### Issue Discovered: Agent Chat Timeout During Long Code Generation

**Problem**: When requesting complex code generation (like a complete chess engine), the MCP client connection times out before the LLM finishes generating the code, even though:
- The server remains healthy and responsive
- The agent processes the request successfully
- The LLM is actively generating code

**Technical Details**:
- Agent 85cda24f (ChessRulesExpert) receives and processes the request
- LLM starts code generation as evidenced in logs
- MCP client receives "Cannot connect to server" error during generation
- This suggests a timeout issue rather than a server failure

**Recommendation**: This confirms the earlier note about needing async operation queuing where:
1. Agent operations are queued
2. Client can check status/poll for completion
3. Long-running operations don't block the connection

## MCP Layer Fixes Applied (2025-09-14 12:22)

### Issues Fixed:

1. **KeyError: 'error' Handling** ✅ **FIXED**
   - Replaced all `result["error"]` with `result.get("error", "Operation failed")`
   - Applied to lines 219, 256, 296, and 317-319 in agent_operations.py
   - Added fallback error messages for graceful degradation

2. **KeyError: 'status' Handling** ✅ **FIXED**
   - Added conditional check: `if 'status' in agent:` before accessing agent status
   - Modified line 236-237 in agent_operations.py
   - Prevents crashes when agent registry doesn't include status field

3. **Workspace Write Failure** ✅ **FIXED**
   - Added `"overwrite": True` parameter to workspace tool calls
   - Modified agent.py line 298-304 to allow file creation/overwriting
   - Should resolve "File exists" issues during code generation

### Technical Changes Made:

**File: `/src/mcp/tools/agent_operations/agent_operations.py`**
- Line 236-237: Added conditional status field access
- Lines 219, 256, 296: Replaced direct `result["error"]` access with `result.get()`
- Line 317-319: Enhanced error message fallback logic

**File: `/src/core/agents/agent/agent.py`**
- Line 303: Added `"overwrite": True` parameter to workspace write operations

### Next Steps:
1. **RESTART Docker Container** - Changes require service restart to take effect
2. Test agent code generation with simple file creation
3. If working, proceed with PyChess orchestration
4. Monitor docker logs for any remaining issues

**Expected Resolution**: All KeyError crashes should be eliminated, and file creation should work properly.
