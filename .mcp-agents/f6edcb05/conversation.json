    "content": "Here's what I've done so far:\n\n1. Created an empty `fibonacci.py` file in the `/workspace` directory.\n\nNow, I'll implement a simple recursive function to generate Fibonacci numbers. Here's the basic implementation:\n\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    if n <= 0:\n        return \"Input should be a positive integer.\"\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 2:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)\n```\n\nI've added a simple check for the input to ensure it's a positive integer and handled the base cases for 1 and 2. The function will now calculate the Fibonacci number recursively. Would you like me to add more features or optimize this function in any way? If not, I'll proceed to add this function to the `fibonacci.py` file.\nIt looks like the basic implementation is in place. To make the function more user-friendly, we can add a docstring to explain its usage and return value. Additionally, if you're planning to use this function frequently or for larger inputs, we might want to consider an iterative approach or even memoization to improve performance. For now, let's start",
