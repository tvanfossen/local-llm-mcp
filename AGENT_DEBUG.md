# MCP Server Debug Session

## Problem: Need to find and test create_agent and chat_with_agent tools

### What I screwed up:
- Went off track looking at processes and files instead of available tools
- Need to focus on finding the specific MCP tools that should be available

### Goal:
- Find `create_agent` and `chat_with_agent` tools
- Test them directly
- Stop overthinking this

### Root Cause Found:
1. **MCP server tools not instantiated** - During refactoring, the MCP tools aren't being exposed
2. **Agent directory is empty** - No agents exist to call
3. **Task tool has nothing to connect to** - No agent system running

### The Real Problem:
The MCP server is running but doesn't expose the `create_agent` and `chat_with_agent` tools that should be available. Need to check:
- MCP tool registration in the server
- Agent system initialization  
- Tool endpoint exposure
